            <div class="mainStory">
                <p>
                First of all, I want to say that this is my second time I do final project. The first time I did is in from <strong>15/06/2023-30/09/2023</strong>, really long and tough time. 
                Just a few more information: I got <strong>4.71</strong> score (less than <strong>5.5</strong>). At that time I used to make a vlog (about one last month) and up it onto my Youtube chanel with no-public mode. 
                Now I place the link <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0tCKH80tqaSd0bUY-tCRT-8WY3mE9oYM">here</a>. It's type is a playlist.    
                </p>
                <p>
                Now, after 3 months taking a break, I'm coming back with this web which is use for:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <u>Practice skill for web developer:</u> I have thought about myself in the future: Who would I be? What I do for living? How can I help my family?... I know that I will get hard to get job from my majority now, then I think about my favorite things, about what I will passion for? Ofcourse, it's Math! Expand more, it could be coding.
                            I love coding a lot, why I don't do it? And web developer just come accross. At the present, I just think about Front-End Developer and I still get shortage of knowledge and skills a lot. I still have to learn myself more.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <u>Check list for final thesis:</u> First, I would create a list of actions what I have to do more with my project, then it will become a small diary (instead of filming video before). By that way I can control my process clearly. I will try to decorate and present it more charming with color and images.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <u>The place for resting after having a hard working day:</u> In fact, I don't like Literature subject when I was at primary or high school, but I love writing. Yes, I can write about my feeling, about anything I see, although in a few second (I'm scared that I will forget when I don't have time to think about it). 
                            When I was in grade 5, at the last semester, because I'm a good student then I recieved a diary book (I'm still keeping it until now). From that time, I start using it to write lyric of the song I love, I wrote poems about my crush, whom never can read that, also some my special Math problems,.. 
                            I believe that express my thought by writing is one of the effect way to reduce stress. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                Maybe it's not all, but it's the main reason why I build this place. Hope you understand and enjoy the next move!!
