        As I introduced before, this place I will write all my feeling at the time I'm doing my final thesis. It would be happy or sad story, but I glad to read it after all this time. Only memories will remain here?

          I have so many works to do now. Lucky for me that it's still not time to come back to school to do my final thesis, that's why I have to use my time now to prepare. Here are something in my mind:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b style="color:black;">Prepare test for tutor works:</b> Yesterday (11/12/2023), Huy, my friend, also the one who introduce me to this job, just texted me that in 18/12/2023 will be the day I start.
              After that time, whenever I have exercise, I should type it into Word file and he will scan and give it to his student.
              For the one who don't know, the origin, Huy just attend this job at the beginning of this year. He will teach 1-1 with his student (Khoi is his name) in grade 10 about Math and Physic. 
              Now he just finished his final thesis, he starts looking for job fit with his majority, that's why he need to reduce some classes he attended to have more time to work.
              And I'm here to take part in half of his work in tutor job: I'll be the one who fix exercises in Math, online class through Google Meeting.
              It would be a nice experience. When me and Khoi are familiar to this, Huy will recommend to Khoi's mom to let me teah Math theory offline.
              So I think I should take advantage of time to prepare exercises before I officially back to school.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b style="color:black;">Think clearly about my final thesis, about the way to do in the next time:</b> The first time I do final thesis have failed and I think it's not complete. 
              Besides that, from brothers in lab, they said that now my teacher don't care about them a lot, just say if they do well, he will let them through. 
              It make me think a lot, about how to improve the old things? How is enough to pass? 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b style="color:black;">Prepare and learn about FE skills:</b> Untill now, the things I know about this field is only HTML and CSS (still not enough). I'm lack of about: JavaScript language program, framework like: React Js, VueJs, Bootstrap,.., design skill: UI/UX,..
              Not only about external skills, one more important thing is the attitude, the logical thinking, the art to make beautiful and responsive web,..
              I  know there are so many struggles now, but I have to come up with, although it would me take more time to be stable.
              This is the way I chose, I have to complete it.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <p>
          Today I'm writing here to strongly and strictly tell myself that I have to move on whatever. Always try my best and believe in the way I choose. 
          I just have demo with Huy about fake fixing exercises. It's took me 1 hour from 19:30 to 20:30, but I have learnt and noted so many skills, how to improve my style.
          He think that, I should have 1 hour like this everyday to practice smoothly. Tomorrow I will meet him again, from 14:00 to 15:00. Everything just started, fighting!
