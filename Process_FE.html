          I have planed to learn more about CSS like: flexbox, grid, animation,.. for long, but I have just activated today. 
          First, I searched documents in the Internet. But this knowledge seem hard for me if I only read article. Then I search in Youtube with key like: CSS grid (I want to learn it first) and I found the interested chanel which is named: HOLE TEX. 
          The video creator is Vietnamese and he makes video to beginner like me. His video not only short (less than one hour) but also the way he presents is easily understand. 
          I have watched the video and write down the note of the lecture at the same time. I will put 3 pictures here are capture the moment I study about grid layout, reponsive with grid and flexbox:
          <div class="cards">
            <div class="picture">
              <img src="image/PFE/101223_CSS_grid_basic.png" alt="grid_basic">
              <figcaption>
                This is screen capture when I'm learning about CSS grid basic. Here is the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://youtu.be/hJHQVpv6-Z8?si=FAUnpnsPePzJJCHz">link</a> of this video.

            </div>
            <div class="picture">

              <figcaption>
                This is screen capture when I'm learning about CSS grid with responsive. Here is the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://youtu.be/gig1RDsLHnM?si=BXgKqyESpc-Kxdl2">link</a> of this video.

            <div class="picture">
              <img src="image/PFE/101223_CSS_flexbox.png" alt="flexbox">
              <figcaption>
                This is screen capture when I'm learning about CSS flexbox. Here is the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://youtu.be/G6mL3t3QzLw?si=DKRDOmyDBMSdB1vi">link</a> of this video.

        </p>
        <p> 
          I have applied it to format again structures in html files (both main and all content files). The next things I want to learn is CSS position and animation.
        </p>

        <p>
          One more step closer, today I have learnt about position in CSS. Well, the video only 10 minutes but I have to reply to understand clearly when the video creator talks about value absolute and sticky of property position.
          Always need time to think about it. From this video, I also see the way he uses property like height, padding, margin to set up dimension for block element. It's really worth following.
          And finally, I will put the screen capture of moment I learn this knowledge like an envidence:
          <div class="cards">
            <div class="picture">
              <img src="image/PFE/111223_CSS_position.png" alt="position">
              <figcaption>
                This is screen capture when I'm learning about position. Here is the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://youtu.be/9Nvq5_0VFLE?si=qhhSU79C3BbfmGqV">link</a> of this video.
              </figcaption>
            </div>
          </div><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have just added the button to back to main page at the right-bottom at each content pages.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="around">
        <p style="text-align: left; color: black;">
          Date: <strong>14/12/2023 22:40</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah, finally I can learn about transition and animation in CSS (continue with HOLE TEX chanel). I really impressed with the way he explains the difficult things.
          From this lession, I also know more about pseudo class of tag "li": after and before. More than that, I know the difference between transiton and animation:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>CSS transition</strong>: have to interact with UI then the animation works.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>CSS animation</strong>: don't need to interact with UI, also can control how many times animations will happend.
              </li>
            </ul>
          At last, here is the screen capture about I'm learning that lession:
          <div class="cards">
            <div class="picture">
              <img src="image/PFE/141223_CSS_animation.png" alt="CSS_animation">
              <figcaption>
                This is screen capture when I'm learning about animation. Here is the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://youtu.be/f8fjyJn8oAE?si=Cou9LI9mhvhhW7ye">link</a> of this video.

            </div>
          </div><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, I know all the knowledge that I have learnt until now only basic. I will think more about how to apply this lession into my website later.
          P/S: I just apply transition to change the background color of button "BACK TO MAIN PAGE", from white to yellow when hover to mouse to it.
          Update: I continue using transition to change the size of image from 80% to 150%;
        </p>

          Today I spent my time to deeply learn more about z-index (although I have heard a lot). Continuing watching from HOLE TEX chanel, I think I have found a lot knowledge here.
          Maybe I just only learn that lession today. See you guys the next time! Don't forget to see the screen capture I took about I'm hard working on this lession!!
